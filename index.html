                <h2>What is Cryptography?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, which can only be deciphered by someone with the correct decryption key. It plays a critical role in safeguarding sensitive information, ensuring privacy, and maintaining the integrity of communications in various domains, including finance, healthcare, and national security.
